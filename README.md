# Predictive Heat Pump Adoption

## Project Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive, production-style pipeline for predicting household adoption of electric heat pumps using machine learning. The project leverages a synthetic dataset with realistic household, housing, and utility features, and demonstrates best practices in data science, model evaluation, and interpretability. The workflow is designed to support policy makers, consultants, and researchers in understanding adoption drivers and targeting outreach efforts.

## Key Features
- **End-to-end pipeline:** Data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and reporting
- **Multiple models:** Logistic Regression (baseline), Random Forest, and XGBoost
- **Interpretability:** Feature importance and SHAP analysis
- **Fairness analysis:** Performance across demographic and regional groups
- **Consulting-ready structure:** Modular code, clear documentation, reproducible environment

## About the Dataset
The project uses a synthetic dataset designed to mimic real-world household, housing, and utility characteristics relevant to heat pump adoption. Key features include:
- **Household income:** Captures economic status and purchasing power.
- **Region:** Reflects geographic differences in climate, policy, and infrastructure.
- **DAC status:** Indicates whether a household is in a Disadvantaged Community, supporting fairness analysis.
- **Housing attributes:** Such as home type, age, and square footage, which influence adoption likelihood.
- **Utility data:** Includes energy usage and costs, providing context for potential savings.
- **Adoption flag:** The target variable indicating whether a household has adopted a heat pump.

The synthetic nature of the data ensures privacy and reproducibility, while still allowing for meaningful analysis and demonstration of modeling techniques. The dataset is explored in detail in the first notebook, where distributions and relationships are visualized to inform feature engineering and model selection.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10+:** Main programming language
- **scikit-learn:** Machine learning models and pipelines
- **XGBoost:** Advanced gradient boosting model
- **SHAP:** Model explainability
- **pandas, numpy:** Data manipulation
- **matplotlib:** Visualization
- **Docker:** Containerization for reproducible environments
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive analysis and reporting

## Example Outputs
- **ROC Curve Comparison:** Visualizes the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates for all models.
- **Feature Importance:** Bar chart showing which features most influence adoption predictions.
- **Fairness Report:** JSON file summarizing model performance across demographic and regional groups.
- **SHAP Summary Plot:** Beeswarm plot showing the impact of each feature on model output.
